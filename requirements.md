# currency-rate-exchange
# Summary:
Using a Java framework of your choice, build a RESTful service for a “Currency Rate Exchange” application. The application aims to pull currency exchange rates from different currency converter public APIs periodically (i.e. every 5 minutes, configurable per provider), store the historical data, and expose all the actual rates through the API. Choose at least two public APIs on your convenience which are providing currency exchange rate data (i.e. ​ Fixer​ , ​ ExchangeRate-API​ ) and try to integrate with them. In addition to this, it’s possible to have our customer currency exchange rate controlled over the RESTful API (adding/updating/removing exchange rate, i.e. USD to EUR). Expected to have an endpoint to be able to convert currencies. Use multilayered architecture and demonstrate concepts of OO design and design patterns (i.e. Dependency Injection, DAOs/Repositories, Services, ...).
